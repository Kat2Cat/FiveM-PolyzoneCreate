exports.ox_target:addBoxZone({   
    points = points,
    thickness = 20.0,
    debug = false,
    options = {
        {   
            name = "TestCase",
            label = "TestCase",
            onSelect = function(data)
                print("Hello World")
            end
        }
    }
})
```
